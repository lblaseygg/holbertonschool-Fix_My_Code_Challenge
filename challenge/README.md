# Fix My Code Challenge

This project is a collection of code fixes for various programming challenges. The goal is to identify and fix issues in existing codebases without completely rewriting them.

## Project Overview

Fix My Code is a unique project where we jump into existing codebases and fix them. Sometimes you'll be familiar with the programming language, sometimes not. The challenge is to identify and fix the issues while maintaining the original structure and approach.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All files should end with a new line
- A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory

## Tasks

### 0. FizzBuzz
**File:** `0-fizzbuzz.py`

A Python implementation of FizzBuzz that prints numbers from 1 to n, replacing:
- Multiples of 3 with "Fizz"
- Multiples of 5 with "Buzz"
- Multiples of both 3 and 5 with "FizzBuzz"

**Issue Fixed:** The original implementation incorrectly handled numbers that were multiples of both 3 and 5 (like 15), printing "Fizz" instead of "FizzBuzz".

### 1. Print Square
**File:** `1-print_square.js`

A JavaScript implementation that prints a square of a given size using the '#' character.

**Issue:** The implementation doesn't correctly print a square of the specified size.

### 2. Sort
**File:** `2-sort.rb`

A Ruby implementation for sorting command-line arguments.

**Issue:** The sorting implementation doesn't correctly handle the input arguments.

### 3. User Password
**File:** `3-user.py`

A Python implementation of a User class with password validation.

**Issue:** The test cases are not passing as expected.

### 4. Double Linked List
**File:** `4-delete_dnodeint/`

A C implementation of a doubly linked list with node deletion functionality.

**Issue:** The node deletion implementation doesn't work correctly.

## Note

This project is optional and will add a project grade of over 100% to your average if completed. Your score won't be affected if you don't complete it, but if your current average is greater than your score on this project, your average might decrease.
